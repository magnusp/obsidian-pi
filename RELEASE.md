# Release process

Pi Agent keeps release assets simple: `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css`.

## Test locally

Use a dedicated Obsidian test vault, never your main vault.

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm run ci
npm run dev:install -- /path/to/vault/.obsidian/plugins/pi-agent
```

Or set a reusable target:

```bash
export PI_AGENT_DEV_DIR=/path/to/vault/.obsidian/plugins/pi-agent
npm run dev:install
```

Then reload Obsidian, or disable and re-enable the plugin.

## Prepare a release

1. Pick the next SemVer version, for example `0.0.2`.
2. Update the version in:
   - `manifest.json`
   - `package.json`
   - `versions.json`
   - `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Regenerate the bundle and run the gate. `npm run ci` never writes, so
   `npm run build` has to run first or the bundle check fails:

```bash
npm run build
npm run ci
```

4. Commit the release prep:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Release 0.0.2"
git push origin main
```

## Publish a release

Create and push a tag that exactly matches the version in `manifest.json` and `package.json`. Use plain SemVer with no suffix: prerelease tags such as `0.0.16-beta.1` do not match the release trigger and could never satisfy the version check.

```bash
git tag 0.0.2
git push origin 0.0.2
```

The GitHub Actions release workflow verifies the quality gate, rebuilds the bundle and checks it against the committed one, extracts the current version's notes from `CHANGELOG.md`, creates a GitHub release, uploads the Obsidian-supported assets, and generates artifact attestations:

- `main.js`
- `manifest.json`
- `styles.css`

For Obsidian Community Plugins, GitHub release assets are what users receive when they install or update the plugin. Do not attach extra files to the GitHub release; Obsidian only supports the assets above.
