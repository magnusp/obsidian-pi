# Privacy

Pi Agent is a desktop-only Obsidian plugin that maintains local RPC subprocesses with the separately installed Pi CLI.

## Data sent to Pi

When you send a message, the plugin can include:

- your prompt and selected text
- current note content and metadata
- backlinks, outgoing links, unresolved links, headings, tags, and frontmatter
- explicit ranked search-result excerpts when you use search attachments or commands
- explicit `@note`, `#tag`, and `/search` attachments
- skill and prompt-template content that Pi expands after applying its resource and project-trust rules
- local chat thread history for continuity
- PNG, JPEG, or WebP images that you explicitly select, paste, or drop into the composer
- UTF-8 text, code, and configuration files that you explicitly select from the vault or local filesystem; content is limited to 64 KiB per file and 192 KiB total, marked when truncated, and sent as delimited untrusted prompt context
- annotations for the active note, including quoted/source text, rendered-selection text, intent, and the context you wrote

Pi may forward this prompt/context to the model provider configured in your Pi settings.

## Network use

The plugin itself does not call model-provider APIs directly and does not include telemetry. Network use happens through the Pi CLI and depends on your Pi provider/model configuration. When an optional nono sandbox is active, nono mediates that network access according to the configured profile, so a profile may allow, restrict, or block outbound connections. When annotations are attached to a prompt, the configured provider can receive their plaintext content along with the rest of the prompt; consult that provider's privacy and retention terms.
The opt-in compatibility smoke command starts Pi with `--offline`, disables discovered resources, and sends no model prompt, so it makes no model-provider request; ordinary chats are not offline unless your Pi configuration makes them so.

When Obsidian is unfocused and the operating system has granted notification permission, the plugin can emit a generic local completion notification. Notification text does not include prompts, note content, thinking, tool arguments, or model responses. Clicking it focuses Obsidian and opens the originating local chat.

Pi extensions can provide local status, widget, and view-title text through RPC. The plugin strips terminal escape sequences and control characters before displaying that text as plain text; status and widget values stay in memory and are not added to prompts or persisted. Only the **Show extension status** preference is stored.

## Local storage

The plugin stores settings, complete local chat history, annotations, and unsent local follow-up queue items as plaintext JSON under `.obsidian/plugins/pi-agent/`. Chat history is kept in `data.json` and checksummed current/previous recovery backup files; it includes captured thinking text when the configured provider exposes it. These files are not encrypted by this plugin. Annotation records include note paths, quoted/source text, optional rendered-selection text, and your annotation context.

Queued image data is stored locally as base64 and queued text-file content as plaintext until the item is sent or removed; once sent, Pi and the configured model provider receive it. Unsupported binaries, PDFs, office documents, and archives are not attached; Pi RPC is not presented as supporting generic binary files. After the plugin restarts, saved follow-ups remain paused until you explicitly resume or discard them, preventing stale prompts from replaying automatically.

Deleting a chat removes it from plugin history and the current recovery snapshot; the rotating previous snapshot may retain it until the next successful save. When a chat has a local Pi session, the deletion dialog separately offers to delete that session file; local Pi data is removed only after choosing that explicit option. Session information shows the local storage path, and HTML export writes a separate local file at the path reported by Pi. Pi session JSONL files are also written under the plugin directory during local runs but remain separate from chat history.

Obsidian Sync, third-party sync tools, backups, or copying the vault may sync or copy the plugin data and therefore the annotations. Their retention and security policies apply. Pi session files are written under the plugin directory during local runs. These runtime files are ignored by git.

## File and shell access

The plugin asks Pi RPC to discover extensions and their commands, prompt templates, and skills when the plugin starts. Pi remains responsible for loading these resources and applying its project-trust decisions; the plugin does not independently read project prompt or skill files for command discovery or expansion. Optional absolute or vault-contained relative skill paths that you explicitly configure are passed to Pi as trusted additional skill paths.

Tool modes control which Pi CLI tools are enabled:

- Chat: no Pi CLI tools.
- Review: read/search/list tools.
- Edit: read/search/list plus edit/write tools.
- Full agent: Pi's complete tool set, including extension/custom tools and shell commands.

Tool modes are not an operating-system sandbox. Only enable Edit or Full agent for vaults and projects you are comfortable letting Pi inspect or modify.

## Optional nono sandbox

When the separately installed `nono` executable is detected on the path Obsidian hands to child processes, the plugin launches Pi as `nono run --silent --profile <profile> --allow-cwd -- pi ...` for every Pi process it starts: chat runs, the persistent RPC session, the model and command catalogs, and the startup warmup. Detection is the only trigger; the plugin never installs nono, and Pi launches exactly as before when nono is absent or the sandbox is turned off in settings.

The sandbox mediates filesystem and network access for Pi and everything it spawns, and denies operations the selected profile does not cover. `--allow-cwd` is passed because non-interactive runs otherwise cannot access their working directory; it authorizes only the access level the profile defines. Because the sandbox sits outside the plugin, its decisions and audit logs live in nono's own state directories (for example under `~/.local/state/nono`), not in the vault, and are subject to nono's retention behavior. The profile may grant access beyond the vault, so a sandbox is only as restrictive as the profile it uses; review it with `nono profile show <name>` and `nono why --self --path <path> --op read|write`.

A sandbox denial that reaches a run is reported as a sandbox failure with `nono why` remediation rather than as a Pi failure. The plugin stores only the profile name, the sandbox toggle, and an optional nono executable path in `data.json`.

## Skills

Skills may contain instructions or scripts. Only enable default or custom skill folders you trust.
